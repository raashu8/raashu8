### 🚀 Hey there! I’m Raashid Muhammed 👋

*🏗️ Full-Stack MERN Developer | UI/UX Enthusiast | Senior Software Engineer*

👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I’m Raashid, a MERN stack developer who loves building scalable, high-performance web applications. With over 5+ years of experience, I specialize in React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and GraphQL.

I have a keen eye for UI/UX, ensuring that every interface I design is smooth, intuitive, and pixel-perfect. Whether it’s optimizing performance, architecting scalable applications, or diving deep into debugging complex UI/Backend issues, I’m always up for the challenge!
