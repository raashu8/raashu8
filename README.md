👋 Hey there! 😄 I'm Raashid, a 25-year-old 🚀 ReactJS developer with over 4️⃣ years of experience! 🔥

💻 My passion for coding began at a young age, and I've since developed a strong skillset in building web applications using 📐 ReactJS, 🔗 Redux, 😎 JavaScript, and 🔢 TypeScript. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and always strive to improve my skills.

🌱 As a young developer, I'm always eager to learn and grow my knowledge. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and experimenting with different coding techniques to keep up with the ever-evolving tech industry.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs and watching programming tutorials on 📺 YouTube or you can 🔍find me in my 🛌bed probably 💤sleeping🤣. I'm also an avid 🎮 gamer and enjoy playing online multiplayer games with my friends(Very few😅).

🤝 I'm always open to new opportunities and collaboration with other developers. Let's connect and build something awesome together! 🚀 Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you want to chat or have any questions! 😊
